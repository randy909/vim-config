Janus is the "ohmyzsh for vim" project:

UltipSnips seems to be a better Snipmate

CtrlP might be better than Command-T but I doubt it's as fast
so I need to see if the extra features are worth the slowdown

<S-CR> (shift-enter) could be used for something cool

NrrwRgn could be useful if I remembered to use it
(why not just use ranges and gv?)

Buffergator is better than BufExplorer
CommantTBuffer might be good too
    (but it doesn't show you which files were modified, do i care?)
or Bufkill if not using a buffer manager

Eclim:
:JavaSearch Blah sometimes works when :JavaSearch (cursor over Blah) does not.
:JavaSearchContext also fails in that context.

YankRing fights with easymotion :\
YR does seem pretty intrusive and I rarely actually use it...
Switching to yankstack

TagBar has a newer version

Vorax fights with easymotion to update the status line while executing

space.vim looks awesome

Neobundle might be good to switch to. If it would make it easy to load different
"profiles" (lists of plugins) depending on some variable I could set that would
be awesome. I want to be able to have a simple mode for windows that doesn't
try to load YCM and other heavy lifters.

Multiple cursur editing plugin like sublime. Looks neat.

The Q command goes into 'ex mode'. This mode is dumb and is being removed from neovim.
Even Bram recommends mapping Q to something useful. I should do that at some point...
