Janus is the "ohmyzsh for vim" project:
https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/

UltipSnips seems to be a better Snipmate

CtrlP might be better than Command-T but I doubt it's as fast
so I need to see if the extra features are worth the slowdown

EasyMotion might be cool

NrrwRgn could be useful if I remembered to use it
(why not just use ranges and gv?)

Buffergator could be better than BufExplorer
