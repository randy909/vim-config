Getting vorax 2.8.7 to work with the new vim compiled against ruby 1.9.1 was a challenge.

In the past I had ruby 1.9.2 on my path compiled from source.
Ubuntu's vim used to use ruby 1.8.7.
In the distant past I had both vim and ruby compiled from source (for command-t).
When I updated ubuntu to 12.10 I got errors from the vorax script.
    - First about the version of ruby (just commented out the check in vorax.vim)
    - Then about antlr, which is weird because it worked before with that version of ruby (1.9.2)
    - Also some flakiness iirc when running sql commands
    - A long lag time when closing vim.

Trying to fix the issues I ended up uninstalling my self-compiled version of ruby 1.9.2
I installed 1.9.1 (which turned out to be 1.9.3) and ruby-switch, not sure the motivation at that point.

I then had a lengthy fight with gem install antlr3 which claimed to install antlr3 successfully
but I could never find the stinking file on the filesystem.
So I finally figured out that setting GEM_HOME and running gem install (without sudo) got
the antlr3 gem installed ok.

Vorax seems to be reasonably happy in this state (assuming ruby 1.9.1 vim bindings which is surely sub-optimal):
    - ruby/gem1.8.7 on the path (actually it seems happy with ubuntu's 1.9.3 as well)
    - GEM_HOME set to $HOME/.gem
    - gem install antlr3

It all seems to boil down to the antlr3 install. Why that was suddenly an issue is a mystery.
Now I know how gems work I guess...

The guy seems to be working on a new version that works with ruby 1.9.1. Hopefully that'll work soon.
I tried the master branch of the github repo he has and it failed epically.

Trying to steal code from the new version seems like a losing battle, he's redone everything.
Maybe contact him and find out if there is a simple way to fix the problem.
